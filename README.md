# Superstore_Tableau
I've been working on an innovative Tableau dashboard utilizing the Sample Superstore dataset. This project has been an incredible journey of data visualization and analysis. ğŸš€

ğŸ“Š The dashboard is divided into two planes for enhanced usability:

The left plane features our company logo, interaction controls, and filters for year and region.

The right plane contains 6 dynamic visualizations and 3 KPI cards based on selected metrics.

Key features include: 
ğŸ”¹ Dynamic visualizations that adjust based on the selected metric (sales, profit, number of orders).
ğŸ”¹ Filtering options for year and region, with a button to hide/display both filters for a better viewing experience.
ğŸ”¹ Consistent display of the top 5 products based on the selected metric.
ğŸ”¹ Interactive filter action on the category chart to dynamically filter data in other charts and KPI cards. 
ğŸ”¹ Clickable logo that redirects to the dashboard published on Tableau Public.
ğŸ”¹ Display of average and trend lines where required.
